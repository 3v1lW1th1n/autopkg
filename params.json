{"name":"Autopkg","tagline":"Automating tedious tasks since 2010!","body":"AutoPkg\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAutoPkg is a system for automatically preparing software for distribution to\r\nmanaged clients. Recipes allow you to specify a series of simple actions which\r\ncombined together can perform complex tasks, similar to Automator workflows or\r\nUnix pipes.\r\n\r\nSee [the wiki](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki#introduction) for more information.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo install AutoPkg, unpack the distribution and run\r\n\r\n`sudo ./install.sh`\r\n\r\nThis will set up a packaging server and a launchd job so regular users can create packages.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nSet MUNKI_REPO in ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.autopkg.plist if you want recipes to populate your munki repository. Has to be XML format for now as it's read with plistlib, and there's a sample file under Test/com.googlecode.autopkg.plist.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n`/Library/AutoPkg/autopkg recipe.plist`\r\n\r\nSample Recipes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nA few recipes are included for your experimentation. The Munki directory contains recipes that import apps into a Munki repository. The Pkg directory contains recipes that create installer packages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
