Todo:
-----

These were migrated over from a TODO list from around April/May 2013.

* Convert these to GH issues:
* Logging and progress display.
* Receipts should include all output messages.
* The recipe directory should be appended to sys.path so Processors can be
  imported from it.
* Implement pkg options.
* Add MunkiInfoInstallsCreator.
* Add --scripts to packagemaker.
* Create an installer package for AutoPkg.
* Chown when creating package roots shouldn't always be recursive.
* Use Foundation to read plists instead of plistlib.
