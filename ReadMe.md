AutoPkg
=======

AutoPkg is a system for automatically preparing software for distribution to
managed clients. Recipes allow you to specify a series of simple actions which
combined together can perform complex tasks, similar to Automator workflows or
Unix pipes.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki#introduction) for more information.
